/// A namespace for organizing type aliases and types related to asynchronous operations.

/// The `Async` namespace provides reusable abstractions for closures, state management,
/// and other tools designed for working with asynchronous programming patterns in Swift.
/// It simplifies common tasks like transformation, result generation, and task state tracking.
