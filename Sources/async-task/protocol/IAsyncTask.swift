/// A protocol defining the behavior of an asynchronous task manager with cancellation and error handling capabilities.
///
/// This protocol abstracts the lifecycle management of a cancellable asynchronous task. It provides functionalities
/// such as state management, error handling, and task cancellation, making it easier to integrate asynchronous
/// operations into applications with a consistent and reusable interface.
///
/// - Note: This protocol is designed to work in environments where updates must occur on the main actor,
///         ensuring thread safety for UI-related operations.
